🧪 Practice & Learning Scope

This repository also includes random Page Object Models (POMs) and test cases created as part of continuous learning and hands-on practice.
These practice tests are added regularly to explore different UI components, improve automation skills, and demonstrate consistency in framework usage.

The goal is to:
